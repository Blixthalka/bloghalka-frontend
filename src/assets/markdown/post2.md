Recently I stumbled on [this](https://dontpaniclabs.com/blog/post/2017/07/27/mapbox-visualizing-workout-activities/) blog post about visualizing workout activites. 
I thought this was really cool, so I figured I try on my own. 
Thus, I immediately downloaded all my runs and rides from Strava and made my own visualizations.
Here are the results.

This is the helicopter view of Umeå, where most of the workouts has been taking place. 
As you see there are many runs in the wilderness and that is because I often run orienteering.

Sandåkern.

This is Gammlia.
I really like running here.
The thick lines here is the famous "SM-spåret".

The metropolis of Sävar, where I grew up.

This is Ålidhem, I lived here for two years during my university studies. 
Notice the track?

Last but not least "mörten" at Täby. 

I thought the results became really cool! 
I'm even considering printing some on a canvas and hanging on the wall.
